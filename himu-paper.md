Climate change, mass extinction of species, degradation of the natural habitat, are problems we are facing and are aware of. Today there is a global consensus that the human impact on the planet is not limited to carbon dioxide, and needs to be reduced, whether it is carbon dioxide, plastic waste, soil use, or other kinds of pollution in the air, land and oceans.

Yet there seems to be another consensus about legislation and government action moving too slowly to minimize human impact below regrettable consequences.

The causes seem to be mostly political: if part of the people are ready to make changes to their way of life, many are not ready to see these changes forced on them, which causes political aversion for too bold actions that could have consequences in elections.

Because of this, and despite the urgency to change, a top-down only approach to reducing human impact cannot realistically meet targets leading us to a safe or desirable future.

At the contrary, market dynamics seem to have consistently outpaced political dynamics in the recent years -in particular in regard to the tech industry-, leading to many legislations being adopted in a reaction to market evolutions.

Bottom-up actions, have proven to engage and complete transitions starting from the markets, till the political level. However in the human impact field, such actions have proven hard to establish on markets, for both technical reasons, financial reasons, and public acceptation reasons.

Taking the example of organic production, which is supposed to be better for the environment than conventional production. [recall the facts with organic: what is the proportion of it in sales? What could be an objective? What is the price difference? What are the problems with getting more organic on the markets?] Transitioning to fully organic production is hard, technically, but even harder business wise. It requires large capital expenditures for farmers, while selling their entire production is hard: people don’t want to pay more for food that looks the same and that sometimes does not present the guarantee of a better quality. Because of market dynamics, people won’t pay a higher price for a product that does not present a guarantee for a greater quality, unless they can clearly visualize the difference it makes on the human impact.

This problem is contiguous with "green marketing", that often puts forward environmental qualities of products without any real ground for it, and even less breakthrough changes, resulting in sticking a green label on an existing product to improve its sales. 

Current limitations

A first reason why it’s extremely hard for the global public to make efforts in favor of a reduction of human impact, is the lack of an efficient and ubiquitous measurement system for each person’s individual impact.

"You can only improve what you measure" - How do you measure your daily environmental impact?

The transition that needs to take place in order to consume globally in a sustainable way will require a complete re-invention and re-construction of the industrial, agricultural, and logistic systems and processes in place. This can only be accomplished with a stronger than ever economy, which we can consider as representing the level of organization that a society achieves in supplying the goods and services demanded by the market (itself).

A popular among governments idea is the Carbon-tax model, and its derivatives. By artificially increasing the price of goods and services perceived as polluting, the hope is to decrease their usage. It however can face several critics, as:
For now, being used mostly to address the Carbon issue, while this is only a small part  (even if important) of the human impact problem; even though in theory it could be applied to every part of the human impact problem.
Applying it to all goods and services could lead to a problematic situation for the less wealthy and poor people where first necessity goods become unaffordable. The problem is even enhanced by the fact that sustainable consumption can be more costly than unsustainable, decreasing the number of options for people without resort. A system of subsidies to counterbalance this effect would be first extremely hard to put in place for practical and political reasons, and hard to monitor to ensure that the intended effect of the impact tax are achieved.
Applying an impact tax to all goods and services would also mean an unequal access to the planet’s resources for each human being, which can be perceived as socially unacceptable.
The higher prices induced by such a tax could also hurt the economy in a way that it could not recover from, which would harm the ultimate goal of transitioning to a sustainable civilization. In particular, higher prices set suddenly and at the same level globally would tend to slow down the economy as they would prevent people from consuming goods and services they cannot afford with their current level of revenue. Such a slow down, if happening in a timeframe that does not allow for the time and investments necessary for the economy to favor the apparition of sustainable alternatives, would lead to a collapse of the system instead of a transformation.
Because of this threat, industry lobbies strongly oppose any such initiative, of a Carbon or impact based tax.
Because countries could maybe agree on an acceptable increase of prices in proportion at PPA, but certainly not globally on an equal value (as an insignificant increase in price for a certain product in a rich country could turn extreme in a poor country, and vice versa), further global disparities in prices would be introduced, with the concrete threat of making the system even less efficient than it currently is. 

As recent riots in France highlighted, ("yellow jacket riots", up to 250’000 people protesting every week from 12/2018 to 06/2019 - of which one among several triggers were the announcement by the French government of increased taxes on fuel) it also appears that a direct financial pressure in order to operate the transition could be met with an adverse reaction by part of the general public.

Furthermore, the problem of human impact on the planet is much wider than just its carbon footprint. Because of its activities, mankind is threatening the existence of millions of species, making thousands of square kilometers of land sterile through desertification, and destroying the natural and/or man-made beauty of countless sites. 

Carbon captures most of the attention of the public and governments because it represents the most immediate threat to our existence, but is by far only a fraction of the problem if we have for objective to maintain, and enhance, the unique habitat characteristics of our planet.

This paper proposes be a part of the solution to reducing the human impact problem, by enabling each individual to measure their environmental impact at each of their consumption choices.

As such, the technical solution that is proposed, has been designed along the following principles:

It should be able to apply to all dimensions of the human impact.
It should not decrease the standards of living of the poorest other than by their own will.
It should not make distinctions based on wealth, country, or any other criteria on the ability of a human to dispose of the resources of the planet. All humans should be born with an equal right to dispose of the resources of the planet.
It should allow the economy to transform at a pace that is sustainable.
It should be designed so as not to create political or lobbyist oppositions.
It should be universal and borderless, useable by individuals of all countries. 

To which the following are added:

It should be built in the interest of mankind and no unique individual or group of individual.
It should not be controlled by, or be under significant influence of any government, lobby, or private interests.
It should adopt a decentralized structure, so as to develop globally, stemming from the people’s willingness to contribute to reducing the human impact.
It should be based on mathematical and scientific rules and reasonings.
It should to be designed to be pervasive, affect the entire production organization of the planet (which is commonly referred to as "the economy") and transform it. 

Concept

The concept is based on an adaptation and augmentation of calculations like the ones done by online evaluations from NGOs. These calculators extrapolate how many planet earth would be needed to sustainably provide resources if the entire population of the planet was to live like a person taking the online test.

Creating a single, universal indicator for all goods and services, giving a measure of their human impact in a single unit.

This indicator represents the environmental cost of each good and service, and as such can be considered and used like a new kind of currency, that is used not instead, but alongside every country’s currency. 

While the usual currencies measure the value of human effort put into providing a good or a service, this currency measures the consumption of the resources of the planet made by this good or service.

Every human gets its right to dispose of the resources of the planet by receiving a certain amount of this currency at the beginning of each month. At every purchase they make, 2 prices need to be paid: the usual one,  representing the "human production effort" value, and a second one, representing the environmental cost associated.

Here is how this impacts decisions on a daily basis. Let’s consider the case of a restaurant offering 2 salads: a beef and parmesan cheese salad, and a vegetable salad. Both of them are offered at the same price of $15. However, as one can presume, the environmental effort required by the beef salad would be much greater than the vegetables one, resulting in a price in the environmental currency being much greater for the former than the latter. Market forces being at play, consumers willing to participate would be inclined to make a choice in favor of the less impacting vegetable salad, without hurting the restaurant’s finances. This acts as an incentive for the restaurant to offer more low-impact dishes.

In a free market, the most powerful force is the market itself. Making the change come from the market is like creating an unstoppable force.

Why make it a currency, and not just an indicator?

For the end-user, a simple indicator measuring the impact of salad A, V/S salad B is enough to help reduce their impact. However, being able to provide this perfectly accurate measurement of the environmental impact for each and every product of a business is possible only at the condition of a perfect awareness of the "impact contribution" of each sub-component of the final product, and of each step in the production of each sub-component. 

This can be seen as considerably hard, unless taking into account that each increment of the impact of the end-product is caused by a step that translates into an economic operation, with necessarily a financial transaction attached to it. As such, it is possible by following the financial transactions all along the supply chain, to link the end-consumer of a salad to the suppliers of each individual raw ingredient. Hence, by also using a parallel currency, the same path can be followed all the way to the top of the supply chain to similarly measure with precision the human-impact cost of any good or service.

Using a currency is the only way to measure accurately at scale the environmental impact caused by every operation in the global supply chain. 

How is the environmental impact information passed along the entire supply chain?

Consumers now pay an environmental price for goods and services. But how is this value passed along the supply chain to determine this final price?

Let’s take the simple case where 100% of the supply chain of a product is compliant with our system. Then, the environmental impact is transmitted simply along the chain using principles analogous to Kirchhoff’s law.
The Kirchhoff law.

The Kirchhoff law is used in electronics, and describes how the total electric current going towards a node must equal the total electric current leaving the node:

Kirchhoff Law

In order for the impact measurement to be accurate, every business along the supply chain needs to follow Kirchhoff’s law: the total amount of environmental currency paid by its customers must equal the amount it’s paying to its suppliers. Or in other terms, the customers are paying for the real net environmental cost of every one of the sub-components used in the product they purchase. 

The impact "credit" is thus passed all the way to the top of the supply chain with a perfect accuracy, as such:


Value passed from the consumers to the raw material producers


This supposes to have a 100% compliant supply chain, which of course can’t be the case out of the box. These concerns and how to circumvent them are addressed later in the text.

Simply summed up, in this ideal scenario, the end-consumers pay for the impact cost of each and every good and service they consume, and so is true of every business until the top of the supply chain. In reality, there are far more end-consumers than businesses producing raw materials: by monitoring and auditing the production of just a few of all businesses, we’re able to track down the exact environmental impact of each good till the end-consumer.


What is the business incentive for them to participate?

The rationale behind using a currency is to use the power of the free market forces to push the economy towards a more sustainable organization. 
First, let’s acknowledge that the system can seem like an incredible burden to businesses, as they would have to give a level of transparency they would not normally be comfortable with, and have to implement a parallel accounting and billing system, including hardware, software, and personnel training constraints.

Some of this burden can be reduced by designing elegant solutions, but it’s reasonable to say that there will always remain an increment of burden for businesses to participate in this system.

Hence, the only way to make up for this burden, if it cannot disappear, is for the system to be designed in a way that will more than compensate it, and bring an advantage to the early adopters.

For this, the greatest force is the great enthusiasm and motivation of some customers, in many parts of the world, to make changes in their life to minimize their impact.
These extremely engaged customers would form the core of early users needed, and voluntarily choose to spend more and more often at participating businesses than in other non-participating businesses.

That helps set target for early adopters in both end-users, and businesses. The former need to be the most environmentally-engaged citizens, the latter could be any business that sell to these customers with a marketing centered around these problematics.

Concrete use-cases of a single, universal indicator

Carbon tax
The carbon tax is a direct impediment to the economy. It impacts the lower social classes more than higher ones (richer people can pay for these carbon taxes and pollute a lot more than poorer people.)
An indicator provides a softer incentive, more accurate. 

Trash bag tax
In countries like Switzerland, all trash must be disposed in government issued trash bags, sold at a high price, to incentivize people to decrease the amount of waste they generate.
This approach takes into account only the overall waste volume, but not the impact of each piece of waste, and does not take into account other aspects intervening in the production process.

Exported waste and pollution
Some countries like China are responsible for a lot of the pollution of the world, but this pollution is caused by the production of goods for other countries, of which the citizens are primarily responsible for. 
Only a measurement/grading system taking into account the entire supply chain is able to give an accurate result. A currency goes through the entire supply chain, and accounts for improvements that suppliers would make in their processes without the need for supervision.

Organic production 
Agriculture that is supposed to be better for the environment (organic or not), is usually hard for farmers to transition to technically, and even harder business wise. Customers have a hard time paying more for a production that can seem equivalent to them. Labels are often not enough of a guarantee to them. A measuring unit allows the market to know exactly what it is paying for, and choose if it is worth it. 

Market competition on ecology
2 products claiming to be environmentally friendly can have very different impacts. A single measurement unit helps the customer understand what is the best value for price, and force companies towards a greater efficiency.

Clarity on marketing
Many products claim to be eco-friendly are only re-branded products with a small tweak, without any real disruption. A clear indicator allows to differentiate pure marketing from real impact. That includes soaps, cars, electric power, carbon-compensated goods, …

Taking into account recycling
Indicators taking into account recycling in their calculation cannot guarantee that a product will be recycled, at the level of performance taken into account for the calculation.
A company recycling products would put back on the market some products with a very low environmental impact, such that it could even make an eco-credit profit, and be able to compensate the people recycling their used goods with eco-credits. 

Incentivizing re-use
Currently many businesses are only interested in selling newly-produced items, as opposed to re-using and repairing, or re-conditioning old, or used items. The considerably lower HI associated with re-using can incentivize customers, and thus businesses. 

Applying well known financial rationality
When choosing between different investment options, for instance when choosing the type of window, roof, or energy generation for a house, a single impact indicator allows to apply the same mathematics used in finance, to calculate ROIs on a longer term. For instance, it could help decide between a low-quality insulation with a low production impact cost, and a higher quality insulation that would have a greater production impact cost.

How is the impact price of goods and services determined in theory (Section in pre-draft)


In order to come up with a single price tag for a good or service being sold, 2 constraints need to be addressed: 

Each product is the result of the action of several transformations, assemblies, and divisions of products or bulks of products, from several suppliers.
Each action on a product or its sub-components might use one or many different and uncorrelated resources (of which we want to measure the usage).
For usage and adoption reasons, only one single price tag should emerge from the sum of all the actions and resources involved in the production of one item.

Hence, in order for the final price to be easy to determine, it should be the sum of the prices of all its sub-components; and each individual resource’s usage impact should be summed in the total using a same unique unit.
Definitions:
To determine any price P for a product, composed of several sub-components, we introduce:
Number of dimensions N: the number of different resources we take into account in the calculation of the price. Each price can be expressed as the (Manhattan) norm of a vector, of which each dimension represents the usage price of one resource.

P = [price of the product]
Pi = [the price of a sub-component "i", used in our product]

Let X, the N-dimensional space for each resource x that we include in the measurement.

For simplicity, we assume that each sub-component i is directly produced from the resources in X, without using any other sub-component.

Let MS in X, the vector of the maximum quantity that can be sustainably used each month of each resource.
MSx = the maximum sustainable quantity of x that all humans can use sustainably each month. This value is set regularly by a panel of experts.

Let Qi, the vector of all quantities of resources x from vector X being used for sub-component i.
Then Qxi = the quantity of x used to produce product i.

Cx = an adjustment constant, unique to each resource, used to make prices human readable and eventually add arbitrary weights on resources.
Pix = Qxi / MSx * Cx
Pi = manhattan_norm(Pix) 

and:
P = sum(Pi) over all sub-components used to produce the product

Because it is more destabilizing for humans to deal with income variations than price variations, using Qix/MSx and Cx as factors (equivalent to the number of times the planet over-consumes this specific resource) helps introduce, enhance, or decrease price differences if some resources’ usage need to be urgently decreased, or fostered.
For instance if a resource is used by the planet 2x more than sustainably reasonable, a 2x factor can applied on the prices of this resource to emphasize the harm.

What is the Manhattan distance or Manhattan norm?

The Manhattan distance between two vectors (or points) a and b is defined as ∑𝑖|𝑎𝑖−𝑏𝑖| over the dimensions of the vectors.

This is known as Manhattan distance because all paths from the bottom left to top right of this idealized city have the same distance:


This is also known as the 𝐿1 norm because the 𝐿𝑝 norm is defined as:

You can see how p=1 and x=a-b leads to the first formula.



With a Manhattan distance to keep track of the usage of resources, in theory, the following problem could happen:

Let A,B and C, 3 resources that we are tracking the usage of. 
For each resource, each human receives (after factoring in weights Ca, Cb, and Cc to normalize each resource’s price) 100 credits to be spent on. 
In this case, each human receives 300 credits. However, if only 100 units of each resource can be consumed reasonably for a sustainable world, nothing prevents a human from buying a good or service that would cost 150 credits, but for which all of the cost would be in 1 of the resources. Taken at scale, this behavior could mean that humans could overshoot the sustainable consumption limit of a resource without breaking the rules of the system, or at least without being conscious of this fact.

This problem can be easily circumvented on the average of a population, by adding and adapting the weights on the dimensions of each resource, based on the overconsumption of this resource. The weights (here Ca, Cb, and Cc) can be updated on a regular basis, to take into account for a sudden over-usage.


How is the human impact of each node in the supply chain, and the final price determined in practice (Where do we get the information from, and how to make up for missing information)

By default, the impact of a good or service is determined by making the worst case scenario assumptions at every step that can’t be measured: producers that do not want to be audited are not participating in the effort to reduce the human impact, and should be penalized, no matter the actual performance of their products.

Strawberries at the market. By default, the default price.
If the seller is part of the program, and the producer of strawberries:
We factor in transportation, point to point, at a default cost. If they want to make a claim that they use a special transportation system that is more ecological, we assess the validity and then factor it in.
The producer: we get from him the quantities of each resource we track that he has used for the production of the strawberries. We track. And we adjust the price of his strawberries.


What is the data structure for this?
A product is defined as a chain of transformations?

Free market model: Each supplier can decide of how much they should charge for their strawberries, but if they do not get from their customers enough to pay for environmental effort they need, it ads up as debt, factored in the prices of everything they sell, proportionally, at the following month.

We just monitor the highest level we can in the supply chain, and let the credits flow to the bottom. This is until we can reach the top level: the root producers or extractors of all the resources we want to include in our HIMU.

For instance, a compliant ecological fertilizer supplier would charge HIMUs to all its farmer clients, that would then need to get them back from the participating stores, and then customers, allowing us to monitor only the highest level fertilizer supplier.

Higher levels suppliers certify that they charge the full HI price for everything they purchase to their compliant clients that buy from them.
Each compliant client certify that they log in the system every and all of the products they use for production of their goods. 

The problem is that:
farmers don’t buy from only one store, some might not be compliant.
farmers don’t sell to only one store, some might not be compliant.
stores do not sell only to system users.

for stores: how do we differentiate sales to non-user customers from waste, that should impact the business’ debt and following month’s prices?
-> the business counts every purchase even from non-compliant customers, and matches each with a check in fiduciary currency. -> this is very cumbersome for the business.
-> soft launch: before we have enough power to enforce counting waste, we only act as a measuring unit, an indicator, that assesses as precisely as possible the HI.
We rely on trust and regular controls. This is not worse than how organic is produced today. -> what are the controls for organic?



Let’s take strawberries. When someone buys generic strawberries in France at the supermarket, the ecoprice is determined from a generic list.
If the producer has registered with us however, we will ask for his usage information of all sorts of items. Their ecological cost will be added. And the total cost will be divided by the total quantity (weight) of strawberries produced, to get an ecoprice per kilo.
The ecoprice of each of the subproducts used to make strawberries will either come from a generic list, or, if their producer is registered, from the actual calculation.
The ecoprice of shipping the strawberries will be guesstimated depending on locations of POS and producer, with a worst case scenario. If there is a better way in place, it will have to be entered in the system.
The system needs to have a full representation of the supply chain of each kind of item sold in the world.
A product, combined with more products, gives a product. The sum of all products’ ecoprice gives the product s final ecoprice.
How does this work practically for the end consumer? App UI.
How do people buy something and quickly pay for it?
How do partner stores give a good breakdown of the eco cost quickly?
An option could be to have bar codes next to each item, that the consumer is scanning when he shops.
The partner shop would fill in online the info about this product.

One option could be to provide, through the App, a service of the kind "Self scan your items", that would deliver a total amount to pay, and an amount paid in currency.

What does our early business user infrastructure looks like? Do they just keep track of things on paper (in which case software is an easy addition), or do they have a complicated stack? (in which case a partnership with cashier providers might be necessary)

Organization Structure

There is a central system that is managed by a central tech team, and an impact assessment team that puts prices on things.
What is decentralized is how other teams go on to onboard more businesses, and market the system to users, on different markets, and assess the real impact.
Strategy team

The strategy team is responsible for writing, and keeping evolving the paper.
The paper is the guide book of the initiative, and contains the rules and principles that apply to the initiative.
The strategy team work on the paper independently, using a version control system such as git, and meets regularly to discuss changes made by everyone, and approve, or disapprove them.

The strategy team defines the requirements for the tech team.
The strategy team chooses the members and voting rights of the members of the environmental exports team.
The strategy team decides and sets the coefficients C for each resouce, in the calculation of prices.

Technical team

The tech team works on an open source model, following requests for features established and prioritized by the strategy team.
A technical committee, appointed by the tech team, is in charge of taking the leadership on the development, assessment of PRs, merges, selection of contributors, and regular code reviews.
The technical team can also include designers and other creators or consultants, able to build necessary parts of the system, for users, businesses or GTM ambassadors.
Environmental experts

The environmental experts should be independent from every team, and every company or private interests.
Their responsibility is to assess, vote, and agree on:
The list of resources that should be tracked.
The reasonable sustainable usage of each resource.
The current usage of each resource.

What is an MVP? 
An MVP in our case would be a system that allows to give a precise measurement of one product of a store, taking into account 1 higher level in the supply chain, and give default HI measurements for all other products.

The MVP can be deployed in 1 test store, partner of the program, with very highly engaged users.

An MVP (V0) would allow the following parties to do the following things:

Appendix: Special cases and questions

What happens if a consumer over-spends?

At each purchase, the price of the good is debited from the credit of the buyer. If the buyer does not have enough balance, the purchase still happens, however its balance goes negative. At the end of the month, the balance is restored to the normal monthly credit. User can thus visualize their monthly performance and track their improvements, and their total debt, month by month, yearly, or lifetime for instance.


Not perfectly fair calculation, works when taken globally. 

It’s not a bug, it’s a feature. It allows for people who need more of a certain resource than another, to be allowed to consume more of this resource than if each human was strictly limited for each resource, as long as they keep spending less than their monthly allowance, mankind as a whole should use only the resources it can sustainably produce.

Prices are set by product, not by product by user: If a user never consumes resource A, and suddenly buys a product that consumes some A, one could say that he should be allowed to "spend" the amount of A that he saved, for free. Yet this would require an extremely complicated dynamic price calculation that would make it hard for groups of people to compare what's best and target what to cut from their purchase and not. The system is not about being perfectly fair, the system is about helping masses consume better in average, so that the global impact goes down.

Can a business charge more to its customers than it paid for (accumulate savings)?
The question of savings is complex and needs to be addressed by experts. If a business was choosing to save for a long time, and spend all of its savings in a day, the impact could be more damageable than using them along the way. Yet there is fundamentally nothing wrong in charging more than it cost (up to the business).
Ultimately, all that can be consumed is paid for by end consumers, and if they pay more for a product, it means they can spend less elsewhere (up to them to see if it’s worth it).  

How do we take supply chain waste into account?

Waste is taken into account by the actual nature of the currency, and can be calculated with a standard double entry accounting. As this is a zero-sum game, the eco credits that the business receives must equal the eco credits the business pays to its suppliers when it buys from them.

To see how much they are wasting, the customers need to be “paying the store” in eco credits. We see how much the store purchases for, and how much it gets from customers. The difference is what they waste.
All this will result in a monsterous database that will need to be kept up to date by partners amid institutions everywhere it’s possible.

How do we take recycling into account?

What about if we take into account resources where humans consume less than the planet can sustainably produce?
